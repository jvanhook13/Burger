# Burger
Burger generator using some handlebars

## What do I do?
I am an app that allows you to order burgers and track which ones you have eaten, because you gotta try em all!!

## How do I work?
On the home page you will be presented with a form to insert a burger, you can choose whether or not youve eaten it in the past so you dont have to worry about updating your burger diary at the restaurant! Once you submit I'll add your burger to the correct list for you! Once you eaten a burger you can click the button to move it to the eaten list, and well if it was so good you wanna eat it again, you can click the button to add it back to the uneaten list.
